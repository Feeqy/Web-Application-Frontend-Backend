# Web-Application-Frontend-Backend
To run the frontend and backend, the node_modules folder must be present which is not in this repository as it's very big.
To get the node_modules for frontend and backend, you would have to install the web services using the terminal. 
The webservices can be found in the package.json file in both frontend and backend.
